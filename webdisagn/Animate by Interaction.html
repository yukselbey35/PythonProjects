/*Description:
In this exercise, you will take a cone and sphere and animate them when you look at them. You are given the objects and the cursor has been set up for you, but you will need to add the animation.

Your Job

Add animation to the cone to turn the cone upside down when clicked. It should then turn it rightside up when clicked again. You will need to use a alternate direction attribute.
Add animation to the sphere to send it backwards by 8 meters when clicked. When clicked a second time, it should return to its starting position.*/
